Hashtable: Separate Chaining

Problems Description
Continuing on the Hashtable demo we discussed in the classroom that is based on separate chaining, which has been included in this homework package, you are required to add a public Object get( Object key) method into the Hashtable class. As defined in the Java documentation, the get() method returns the value with which the specified key is associated, or null if this hash table contains no record for the key. More formally, if this hash table contains a mapping from a key k to a value v such that (key.equals(k)), then this method returns v; otherwise it returns null. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

Specifics:
a)	You have to implement the get() method as described above.
b)	Please use the following Tester.java code to test your get() method implementation, the Tester.java source file is also included into this homework package.
